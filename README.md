This is my solution - story for the visualisation of the dummy data provided. 

The original focus is on the metric of popularity for every video based on the cumulative views, likes and shares of the video. An average of these three metrics along with a normalisation for the time frame measured has been used to provide the bubbles visualisation. 

The color of the bubble corresponds to a specific product acoording to the color legend. 

The size of the bubble corresponds to the popularity metric of the video. 

Clicking on every bubble gets you to a video specific page where you can have a time series visualisation of the popularity metrics for every video along with a display of the localisation of the video metrics. 

The web app renders a different visualisation (RickShaw Charts) for mobile devices since the web version uses Google Motion Charts which are Java based and non mobile friendly. 

Many improvements can be done based upon having access to a data API, like build AngularJS directives to access data and visualise upon fetched data with D3. 

You may see a live demonstration of the visualisation at
